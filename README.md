# Bucketeer

A Swift mini-framework for analysis data, where you have a data set of different items and each item can have different metrics attached to it.

Feature set:

- `Bucketeer.buckets(by:option)`: Split data into buckets by fixed thresholds for each bucket, by having buckets of uniform width, or by buckets of the provided percentiles. 

More to come...
